             <p data-ag-editable="PI Info Left">Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics before prescribing Neulasta. Human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Neulasta<sup>®</sup> is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim, recombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. <strong>PHARMACEUTICAL FORM:</strong> solution for injection presented in pre-filled syringes containing 6 mg of pegfilgrastim in 0.6 ml, single dose use only. <strong>INDICATION:</strong> Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). <strong>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</strong> One 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, administered subcutaneously approximately 24 hours following chemotherapy. The experience with Neulasta<sup>®</sup> in children is limited. <strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. <strong>SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:</strong> Limited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for pegfilgrastim and filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, the long-term effects of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> have not been established in de novo AML; therefore, it should be used with caution in this patient population. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. The safety and efficacy of Neulasta have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. The safety and efficacy of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> administration in de novo AML patients aged &gt; 55 years with cytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. The safety and efficacy of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> have not been investigated in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Rare pulmonary adverse effects, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF administration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. Onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates, deterioration in pulmonary function with increased neutrophil count may be preliminary signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances Neulasta<sup>®</sup> should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment given. There have been common but generally asymptomatic cases of increased spleen size and very rare cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g., clinical examination, ultrasound) and this diagnosis should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. Treatment with Neulasta alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended during Neulasta<sup>®</sup> therapy. Neulasta<sup>®</sup> should not be used to increase the dose of chemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. Physicians should exercise caution and monitor appropriately when administering Neulasta<sup>®</sup> in patients with sickle cell disease and be attentive to the possible association of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> with splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. Transient elevation of leucocyte counts ≥ 100 x 109/L have been observed in &lt; 1% of patients receiving Neulasta<sup>®</sup> with no attributable adverse events. Elevations were typically seen 24–48 hours after administration. The safety and efficacy of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> for the mobilization of blood progenitor cells in patients or healthy donors have not been adequately evaluated. The needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (latex derivative), which may cause allergic reaction. Exercise caution when interpreting bone-imaging results as increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging findings. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine as it contains</p>

Neulasta contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. <strong>INTERACTIONS:</strong> Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ Neulasta<sup>®</sup> should be administered approximately 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Concomitant use of Neulasta<sup>®</sup> with chemotherapy has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models, concomitant Neulasta<sup>®</sup> and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other antimetabolites have been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.  Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically investigated in clinical studies. The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. The safety and efficacy of Neulasta have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas. <strong>PREGNANCY AND LACTATION:</strong> There are no adequate data in human pregnancy and lactation. Neulasta<sup>®</sup> should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Neulasta should not be administered to women who are breast-feeding. <strong>UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS:</strong> The most frequently reported study drug-related undesirable effect was bone pain, which was generally mild to moderate, transient, and controlled with standard analgesics. Allergic-type reactions, including anaphylaxis, skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, hypotension, injection site reactions, erythaema and flushing have been reported with Neulasta<sup>®</sup>. Permanently discontinue use in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction. Reversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase, with no associated clinical effects, occurred in patients receiving Neulasta<sup>®</sup> following chemotherapy.  Nausea was observed in healthy volunteers and patients receiving chemotherapy. <strong>Incidence of undesirable effects:</strong>  Common but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and very rare cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal cases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim. Other commonly reported undesirable effects include pain, injection site pain; chest pain (non-cardiac); headache; arthralgia; myalgia; back, limb, musculo-skeletal and neck pain. Rare pulmonary adverse effects including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Some of the reported cases have resulted in respiratory failure or Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal.  Rare cases of thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis have been reported.  Rare cases of Sweet’s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying haematological malignancies may play a role. Very rare events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients, although the mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving Neulasta is unknown. Very rare elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following cytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. Isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell disease. A higher frequency of serious adverse events in younger children aged 0-5 years has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11, 12-21 years and adults. The most common adverse study medicinal product reaction was bone pain <strong>PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS:</strong> Store in a refrigerator at 2°C–8°C. Do not freeze. Keep container in outer carton to protect from light. Neulasta<sup>®</sup> may be exposed to room temperature (not above 30°C) for a maximum single period of up to 72 hours. Avoid excessive shaking as this may aggregate pegfilgrastim, rendering it biologically inactive. Neulasta<sup>®</sup> is incompatible with sodium chloride solutions. <strong>LEGAL CLASSIFICATION:</strong> POM <strong>MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER:</strong> Amgen Europe B.V., Minervum 7061, 4817 ZK Breda, the Netherlands.
